description: As part of my 3rd year courses, I worked on a machine-learning project investigating usage of the CounterFactual Regret Minimisation (CFRM) algorithm for solving games with hidden (where opposing players cannot view each other's state). Working under supervision by Dr. John Shapiro, I was able to successfully apply the algorithm to solve 2 and 3-player Kuhn Poker (simplified versions of Poker) to determine the best strategy for each player. I was also able to investigate and implement various methods to boost performance when running the algorithm. The source code and project report are available <a href="https://github.com/PranavBahuguna/KuhnTrainer">here.</a>
