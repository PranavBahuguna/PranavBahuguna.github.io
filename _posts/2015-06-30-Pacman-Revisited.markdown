description: During the Great Uni Hack Manchester in April 2015, our team (consisting of me, Obrien Sim, Kieran Hall and Rosen Dangov), recreated the classic Pacman game in 3D. The game functions similarly to the original and includes ghosts that follow and can kill the player. It was built  using the Unity 5 engine. The challengepost entry for Pacman Revisited can be found <a href="http://challengepost.com/software/pacman-revisited">here</a> and the Github repo may be found <a href="https://github.com/PranavBahuguna/Pacman-Revisited">here.</a>
