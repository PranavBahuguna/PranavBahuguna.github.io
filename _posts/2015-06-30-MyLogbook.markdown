description: As part of my Computer Science course in First Year, we were required to build a website of our choosing that featured use of a database in it's operation. My group (consisting of me, Hikmet Haciyev, Andrei Muntean and Sebastian Costin), created an online web version of the programming logbooks that we used in our programming courses. The site allowed a user to create an account and provided a UI to allow one to write logs and tables in folders called logbooks, that are stored in a central database. In addition, the website (with the exception of the TinyMCE editor) was written completely from scratch. The Github repository for the site may be found <a href="https://github.com/andreimuntean/Logbook">here.</a>
