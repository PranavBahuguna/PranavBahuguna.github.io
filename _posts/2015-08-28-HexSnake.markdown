description: This snake game that I developed over the summer of 2015 is unique in that it uses a hexagonal rather than square grid. The current version of the game (with undeveloped features made inaccessible) is available on this <a href="https://github.com/PranavBahuguna/HexSnake">Github repository</a>.
